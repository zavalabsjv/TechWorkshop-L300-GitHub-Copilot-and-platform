# Exercise 01: Setting up your development environment

## Scenario

This training will have you implement a customer proof of concept using DevOps and AI-driven development practices. The customer in this scenario is Zava, a retail chain that specializes in "do-it-yourself" solutions for home improvement projects. Zava has a simple storefront prototype and would like to establish best practices for DevOps setup and AI-assisted development and delivery. In this lab, you will configure GitHub Enterprise with security best practices, set up Visual Studio Code, GitHub Copilot, and Azure MCP Server to streamline DevOps planning and delivery, and extend the solution using Azure AI Foundry to generate and enhance application code.

In this exercise, you will set up your DevOps environment and build and run the solution, in preparation for later exercises.
 
## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will:

* Have GitHub Enterprise setup for your organization, and in a later exercise we will configure security best practices with GitHub advanced security
* Have a fork of the lab repository, and a local clone that you can build and run to validate the starting point of the solution
* Have installed necessary extensions to Visual Studio to support later exercises with agentic DevOps

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes
