# Task 04 - Build the solution

## Description

During this task you will clone the repository you forked, and build the solution to ensure you have a baseline for the next exercises.

## Success Criteria

- You have cloned the lab repository you forked
- You are able to build the solution and run it locally

## Learning Resources

- Cloning a repository via the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Clone the forked repository

Clone the repository you forked on your local machine. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-forked-repository>.git
```

Make sure to replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username, and `<your-forked-repository-name>` with the repository name where you forked the code.


### 02: Build and run the solution locally

From Visual Studio Code, you will build and run the current .NET 6 version of the solution locally at first. After running the application you will see this web application:

#### Steps to build and run the solution (.NET 6)

1. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code**
   - Launch VS Code and open the folder containing your cloned repository.

2. **Restore dependencies**
   - Open a terminal in VS Code and run:
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     ```

3. **Build the solution**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     dotnet build
     ```

4. **Run the application**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     dotnet run --project src/ZavaStorefront.csproj
     ```
   - This will start the web application. The terminal will display the local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or similar).

5. **Open the application in your browser**
   - Navigate to the displayed local URL to view and interact with the running solution.

> **NOTE** If you encounter any issues, verify that .NET 6 is installed and your dependencies are restored. For troubleshooting, consult the official [.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/get-started).
